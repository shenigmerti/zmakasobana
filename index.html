        <p>lukari is a famous georgian pop star.aka shenighmerti,gl hf hf luzeri xar patara
            broski, zaza baza bebos braza gushin xodi gaimaza.<br>Yeah
            I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
            But hey, what daddy always tell you?
            Straighten up little soldier
            Stiffen up that upper lip
            What you crying about?
            You got me. Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
            When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
            I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
            I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
            'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
            No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
            We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
            Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
            We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
            When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls</br>Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you
            Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
            I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
            The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
            All the things growing up, his daddy, daddy had to see
            Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
            We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
            But things have gotten so bad between us, I don't see us ever being together
            Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
            But then of course everything always happens for a reason
            I guess it was never meant to be
            But it's just something we have no control, over and that's what destiny is
            But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
            Maybe one day we'll wake up, and this will all just be a dream
